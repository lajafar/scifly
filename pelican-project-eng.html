                            <b>Goal:</b> organize population monitoring of Dalmatian and Pink Pelican colonies OR optimizing population estimates<br>
                            <br><b>Tasks:</b> …<br><br>
                            
                            Dalmatian and Pink Pelican Conservation is a program that studies and protects rare birds in the wild. To preserve the Russian pelican population, especially that part that lives outside reserves, scientists need to monitor and estimate the number of birds, their movements, and the well-being of nesting colonies.<br><br>
                            
                            Pelicans living in Russia, curly and pink, are at risk; the observed decline in the level of well-being of their populations is due to climatic and anthropogenic factors. In this case, pelicans are considered as indicator species.  <br><br>
                            
                            To preserve pelicans, scientists need to conduct constant monitoring.<br><br>
                            
                            One of the program's objectives is to monitor breeding colonies, feeding and seasonal aggregations of Dalmatian and pink pelicans, especially outside reserves. In the Ciscaucasia, birds mainly live in artificial reservoirs - man-made lakes and ponds.<br><br>
                            
                            <b>Problem:</b> existing (manual) methods for estimating headcount are labour-intensive and do not give accurate results.<br><br>
                            
                            Until recently, pelicans were counted manually - it took a week, and the estimate was approximate.  <br><br>
                            The number of birds was determined by the “pin method.” To do this, they took an aerial photograph, for example, from a quadcopter and marked each bird in the frame with a pin. <br><br>
                            The pin method is complex and labour-intensive, only providing approximate data. The last time the birds were counted seven times, each time a new result was obtained. It’s scary to talk about the time required: counting 2100–2200 individuals took a week.

                        <p>
                            Estimating the population size of pelicans by ornithologists is the most time-consuming and monotonous task, so we focused on automating this part of the ornithologists’ work and used computer vision. Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence that uses neural networks to solve problems, including detection and classification problems. In other words, the trained model can localize an object and assign it a class (label) - an adult or a chick, in our case.<br><br>
                             The introduction of computer vision technologies allows you to quickly obtain the data necessary to assess the situation by processing source materials according to their number and distribution.  <br><br>
                             Data collection<br>
                             In 2020, regular data collection on these colonies began; during this time, we could collect and create an archive for each year of observation.

                            The technical implementation process for monitoring the number of pink and Dalmatian pelicans consists of three [four] stages: [building a pipeline], image processing and generating a data set on which the model will be trained, training the model, and developing a service, a wrapper for the model. The service allows you to access the model and receive predictions about the number of individuals and their location in the image (rendering bounding boxes).

                        <h2>Development prospects</h2>

                        <p>
                            We continue to work on the automation of pelican monitoring. There are plans to improve the model by moving to a new version of YOLOv7 or YOLOv8 and introducing model acceleration techniques for video processing. 
                            In addition, it is very important to improve the recognition quality by training the model on current images taken strictly from above and images where pelicans are shot from other angles, for example, at an angle.
                            We expect that:<br>
                            the model will work acceptably quickly on video;<br>
                            The model will give an acceptable and complete result for new images.<br><br>
                           
                            We also continue to develop a community around problems of the state of biological species in Russia and abroad, in particular, pelicans.<br><br>
                           
                            The service we are creating in the cloud is important for ornithologists and has a global goal. In this case, the pelican is an indicator species, allowing one to judge environmental changes by their behaviour.  <br>
                            By tracking the condition of colonies, we will be able to assess the environmental situation and predict climate change more accurately.
